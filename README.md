# Project: API and Web Data Scraping

## Overview

In this project you will find .ipynb script designed to scrape Indeed website using Python and Selenium WebDriver and a CSV file as a result of the query.


The following filters have been applied:

Location:

Mexico

Open positions:

Data Scientist
Data Engineer

## Obstacles and lessons learned
In this project the main obstacle was defining what my project would be and defining a pipeline for it.

After finishing this project, I learned how to scrape different objects from a website by different methods. At the end, I present a cleaner and clearer code.

I would like to upgrade the function for extracting data so that the user can write the job and obtain a CSV file as a result.

## Requirements


* Python 3.6+
* Works on Linux, Windows, macOS, BSD

## Deliverables

You will find the following deliverables:

* **A Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file** that contains the code used to scrape the web page.
* **An output folder** containing the outputs of scraping data.
* **A ``README.md`` file** containing a detailed explanation of the approach and code for retrieving data from the API and scraping the web page as well as your results, obstacles encountered, and lessons learned.

## Let's Get Started

* **Find a web page to scrape** In this project I worked with [Indeed](https://mx.indeed.com/) to obtain data about job postings.
* **Consult documentation and resources provided** to better understand the tools you are using and how to accomplish what you want.
* **Determine the content you woul like to scrape from it** The information would be Job title, Company, Location, Date of the post, Date of query, Summary, Job URL and Salary.
* **Create a DataFrame, convert it to CSV and obtain insights** The information we obtain was about where is the location with highest job postings and companies with the highest job postings.
